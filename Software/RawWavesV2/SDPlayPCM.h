// Audio system AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES is 128 and runs at 44k 16bit
// This means we need 2 BLOCKS of bytes for a block 44k 16
// 3 for 44k 24bit
// 6.54 for 96k 24bit
// TODO : Use 2 buffers. 1 for multiples of 44k and 1 for multiples of 48k
// If there is a reasonable buffer size which is byte aligned at 48k
// e.g. an 836 byte buffer would have enough samples to fill 3 blocks for 48/16 -> 44/16
// NOTE : Make sure this is a factor of 2 AND 3 otherwise 24-bit samples will be split
// across the buffer boundary and that will make things go wrong.
