## Raw Waves v2

Raw Waves v2 is a sample player that functions much like a live radio. Audio sample files may be placed on a MicroSD card, and arranged into "banks" (like channels) which you may select either manually through the panel knobs, or via CV. File formats supported include RAW and WAV files.

The module is functionally identical to the popular "Raw Waves" module, and its predecessor, "Radio Music" by Tom Whitwell of Music Thing Modular. These previous modules are no longer available, having been built upon the now-discontinued Teensy 3 microcontroller.

Raw Waves v2 has been completely redesigned to use the Teensy 4 platform. Because the module uses the Teensy 4 microcontroller, the "Raw Waves v2" will not be compatible with other alternative firmware made for Radio Music (e.g. 'Chord Organ').

Raw Waves v2 still supports all of the settings in the SETTINGS.TXT file that you came to know and love in the earlier models. If you haven't played with the settings, you really should!

#### Specifications
Audio output: 16-bit audio output, with hardware anti-alias filtering.
Dimensions: 4 hp, 21mm deep.
Power specifications: Requires +12v (at 100 mA) and -12v (at 10 mA). The module features several protections against accidental reverse power connection: First, a keyed 10-pin Eurorack standard connector, second, automatically resetting fuses, and thirdly, protection diodes.
CV Inputs are designed for 0-5v, with reasonable over/undervoltage protection built-in.
